1. ABSTRACT
-----------

The functions and scripts in this software package (MATLAB) perform phase-sensitive detection (PSD) analysis of a 
matrix of time-resolved modulation-exciatation (ME) characterization data within a pre-determined reversible regime. 
Notably, it averages the given periods in an incremental or decremental fashion, and provides the option to perform PSD 
with an adapted demodulation index, i.e. going beyond the fundamental frequency. It additionally includes analysis codes
to perform kinetic differentiation (determination of in-phase angles) of the generated phase-resolved spectra.


2. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
------------------------

All functions and scripts were written in the MATLAB environment, using version 9.7.0.1190202 (R2019b). 
For optimal performance, the use of MATLAB version 9.7.0.1190202 (R2019b) or higher is recommended.

4. GETTING STARTED
------------------


To get started with the software, the user should first read the manual/gudelines on these codes in the attached document "Description_MES_PSD_Codes_LCT.docx", and then
copy the necessary MATLAB functions in an accessible directory.
Further, it is suggested users possess a modulation-excitation dataset, MEXAS/MEDRIFTS/MEXRD..., collected in a datamatrix wherein the rows represent spectra
collected at a certain time instance and every column corresponds to measurements as a function of time at a certain abscissa value (e.g. energy, wavenumber, Bragg
diffraction angle). Prefereably, this dataset only contains the reversible regime of the ME data. This data should be copied in the same directory as the MATLAB functions.
Finally, users should apply the PSD_increasingperiods.m and the KineticDiffMEXAS.m functions in accordance with their decription in "Description_MES_PSD_Codes_LCT.docx".


5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS/BUGS
-------------------------

PSD_decreasingperiods.m tends to stop analysis at the penultimate period, and not the final one.

7. CONTACTING THE AUTHOR(s)
---------------------------

We would very much appreciate hearing from you if you use the ME(XAS)-PSD Analysis Toolbox and find problems,
or if you can think of ways it could be improved - and even (or is that
'especially'?) if you just think it's great. Even if the facility you would
like to see appears to be of interest only to you, tell us about it - you'd be
surprised how many ideas in that class have a much wider appeal.

See above for further contact information.

We read and consider all mail we receive, even though we may not have time
to reply
